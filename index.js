/*Write a program that takes a positive number (num) and finds the power of 2 nearest to that number. 
The program stores the resulting value to pwr. Then you log the answer in this format: 
“The number (pwr) is the power of 2 nearest to (num).”

If there are two candidate values, display the smaller one. For example, 2 and 4 4 are both the powers of 2 nearest to 3. The function should display 2 because it’s smaller than 4.

For example,
If num = 40, pwr = 32. Then you log to your console in this format:
“The number 32 is the power of 2 nearest to 40.”

If num = 50, pwr = 64.. Then you log to your console in this format:
“The number 64 is the power of 2 nearest to 50.”*/
